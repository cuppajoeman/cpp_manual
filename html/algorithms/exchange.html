<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>When you want to replace the value of a variable while keeping its old value, you usually have to introduce a temporary variable:</p>
<pre><code>
int x = 5;
int new_value = 10;

int old_value = x;
x = new_value;
</code></pre>

<p><code>With exchange, we no longer need this:</p>
<pre><code>#include <utility>

int x = 5;
int old_value = std::exchange(x, 10); 
// x is now 10
// old_value is 5 (the original value of x)
</code></pre>
